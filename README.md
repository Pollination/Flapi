#Flapi
...is a fluent API generator for Java. Fluent builders allow developers to more easily interact with your code, using a syntax more akin to natural language.

To use:

Add the maven dependency or jar to your project. Using the included classes,
build a descriptor. Use the descriptor to generate code files in a directory.
Finally, pull those files into your project. Implement the various *Helper
classes and their methods. Once everything is wired together you can make
use of your new API!

See [the wiki](https://github.com/UnquietCode/Flapi/wiki) for more information on how to get started. You might also
find some useful examples in the src/test directory.


Enjoy!
